üõ† Requirements
You need Python 3 installed.
All three projects use these Python libraries:

numpy ‚Üí for working with 3D points

opencv-python ‚Üí for drawing and webcam

trimesh ‚Üí only for the 3rd project (to load a 3D model)

To install them:
pip install numpy opencv-python trimesh

Also, the third project needs a 3D model file: ship.obj
Make sure it's in the same folder as the code.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run Each Project
1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic 3D Ship (Mouse Control)
This project creates a 3D ship using only code (NumPy arrays).

You can move the camera using the mouse.

It runs in a window with a simple 3D scene.

Controls:

Left click + drag mouse ‚Üí move forward/backward, left/right

Right click + drag mouse ‚Üí move up/down

2Ô∏è‚É£ 3D Ship with Face Tracking
This project adds face tracking using your webcam.

When your face moves, the camera also moves.

You don't need to click anything ‚Äî just use your face!

Controls (Face):

Move face left/right ‚Üí camera moves left/right

Move face up/down ‚Üí camera moves up/down

Move closer/farther ‚Üí camera zooms in/out

üí° Webcam must be working. Good light helps better detection.

3Ô∏è‚É£ 3D Ship Model Viewer (.obj file)
This project loads a real 3D model from a .obj file.

It shows the ship with lighting and perspective.

You can move and rotate the camera using your mouse.

Controls:

Left click + drag ‚Üí move camera (pan)

Right click + drag ‚Üí rotate view (orbit)

Mouse wheel ‚Üí zoom in/out

‚úÖ Make sure the ship.obj file is in the same folder.
